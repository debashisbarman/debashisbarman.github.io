{"name":"Debashis Barman","tagline":"Freelance Web Designer","body":"My name is Debashis Barman and I am a Freelance front end Web Designer. I try to make the websites I design and build as simple and intuitive to use as possible whilst still having a unique aesthetic appeal. I specialise in responsive front-end design, HTML/CSS and web typography.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm free, I spend my time exploring places and beyond, adventuring in the wilderness, learning about the world, working on tiny side projects, writing, romancing my lovely girlfriend, sketching and doodling, reading short stories and novels, listening to music and playing games. And internet. I love internet.\r\n\r\nFeel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_DebashisBarman), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/debashisb04), [Google +](http://plus.google.com/+DebashisBarman), [Tumblr](http://debashisbarman.tumblr.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@Deb_Speaks), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/debashisbarman/) or anywhere else you can find me.
