Decided to reconstruct my site by redesigning it. The goal was a clean and minimal content focused layout. So I started removing all the unnecessary components and finally arrived at this current layout. 

Few things about my site:

<ul class="li-circle">
<li>Stylesheet by Debashis Barman</li>
<li>Built on <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the open source static site generator</li>
<li>Hosted on <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a></li>
</ul>

The design and source code powering this site is available on my github [repository](http://github.com/debashisbarman). Source code can be used for your Jekyll sites. But before using the source code, keep in mind that the following directories and their contents copyright Debashis Barman. These are not available for re-use without permission.

<ul class="li-circle">
<li>_posts/</li>
<li> images/</li>
<li> assets/</li>
</ul>

All other directories and files are [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Licensed. Feel free to use the HTML and CSS as you please. If you do use them, a link back to [http://debashisbarman.github.io](http://debashisbarman.github.io) would be appreciated.
