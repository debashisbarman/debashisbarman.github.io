Decided to reconstruct my site by redesigning it. The goal was a clean and minimal content focused layout. So I started removing all the unnecessary components and finally arrived at this current layout. 

This layout is highly inspired by [Dogma WordPress Theme](http://understandingminimalism.com/dogma/). Since dogma is uncopyrighted and free, I edited the theme as per my requirements.

Few things about my site:

* Stylesheet by [Debashis Barman](http://www.debashisbarman.in)
* Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the open source static site generator
* Hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)

The design and source code powering this site is available on my github [repository](http://github.com/debashisbarman). Source code can be used for your Jekyll sites. But before using the source code, keep in mind that the following directories and their contents **Copyright** Debashis Barman. These are not available for re-use without permission.

* _posts/
* images/

All other directories and files are [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Licensed. Feel free to use the HTML and CSS as you please. If you do use them, a link back to [http://debashisbarman.github.io](http://debashisbarman.github.io) would be appreciated.
