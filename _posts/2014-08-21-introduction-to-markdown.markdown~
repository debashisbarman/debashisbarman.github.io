>Markdown is a way to write content for the web. Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it optionally can be converted to _HTML_ using a tool by the same name. 

Markdown is popularly used for _readme files_, for writing messages in online discussion for writing messages in online discussion forums or in text editors for the quick creation of rich text documents. It's written in what nerds like to call **plaintext** which is exactly the sort of text you're used to writing and seeing.

In this tutorial, we'll learn the basics of markdown.

##Basic Writing

###Paragraphs

Paragraphs in markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

`This text is written in markdown as an example of paragraph`

###Headings

To make headers in Markdown, the phrase is preface with a hash `#` mark. For example for header one, you'd use one hash mark.

`#This is header one`

###Bold and Italic

To make a phrase **bold** in markdown, the phrase is surrounded with an `*` and for making a phrase _italic_, an underscore `_` is used.

##Lists

###Unordered Lists

An **unordered list** can be achieved by preceding list items either with a `*` or `-`.

###Ordered Lists

We can make an **ordered list** by preceding list items with a number. For example,

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

###Nested Lists

Nested lists can be created by indenting list items by **two spaces**.

##Code Formatting

###Inline

A single backticks is used to format text in special monospace format.

###Multiple lines

For multiples lines three backticks are used.

##Blockquote

Blockquote is achieved by putting a `>` before the phrase.

##Links

Links are created by wrapping the link text in brackets `[]` and then wrapping the link in parenthesis `()`.

For example `[Debashis Barman Homepage](http://www.debashisbarman.in)` will create the link [Debashis Barman Homepage](http://www.debashisbarman.in).
