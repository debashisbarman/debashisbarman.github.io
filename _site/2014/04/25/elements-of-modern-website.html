  <p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website     including writing mark up. Every year, we see new website design elements emerge. But what are the latest features to include?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some important elements of modern web design that one can include. You don’t need to have all of them, but this list will get you started.</p>

<p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> It is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices i.e. from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors. A responsive website adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries.</p>

<p><strong>Flat Design:</strong> Flat design is known for its simplistic appearance. Instead of using three-dimensional effects and other design techniques, flat designs use simple illustrations that typically have bright colors.</p>

<p><strong>Typography:</strong> Typography refers to the use of fonts on the World Wide Web. Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a unique style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles.</p>

<p><strong>Well Planned Color Scheme:</strong> Color, on its own, is a really powerful tool; so use of a well planned color scheme adds a lot of contrast to a website, giving it a properly balanced, harmonious, energetic, and even complex looks.</p>

<p><strong>Large Background Images:</strong> Now a days most of the websites use the trend of a large photo background which is responsive in nature. That means responsive background images conform to any screen size whether you are viewing the image from your desktop, tablet, or mobile device; you will be able to view the image clearly without scrolling up and down and side to side.</p>

<p><strong>Smooth Scrolling to Page Sections:</strong> Unlike a typical website, instead of clicking a link and landing on a new page, modern websites have a smooth scrolling feature where you click a link and it brings you to a different part of the page. It is mainly done by CSS and jQuery plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Large Product Images:</strong> Modern websites tend to display large product images on their sites to highlight different features or parts of their product. This element is another important design tactic that we are seeing more and more.</p>

<p><strong>Product Videos:</strong> Modern websites also use in-depth product videos to talk about the benefits of their products as well as new features that come out.</p>

<p><strong>Font Icons:</strong> Using <em>fonts</em> for <em>icons</em> is a great way to achieve scalability and it is very common in modern web design. The only limitation being color (and possible compatibility with some browsers).</p>

<p><strong>Hover Effect:</strong> Hover effects help you identify where you are on a page. When you place your cursor over a part of a website that has a hover effect, it usually changes colors or highlights letting you know where you are looking.</p>

<p><strong>The visual appearance of your website draws viewers in, but compelling content keeps them engaged!</strong> Once you have a great website design, don’t forget to put your time and effort into creating great content that will give your visitors what they’re looking for.</p>
