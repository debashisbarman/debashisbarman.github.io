Kathamo
=======

Kathamo is a minimalist CSS framework that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone.
>Kathamo is an Assamese word, literary meaning "structure" or "frame"; thus the name itself suggests a framework. 

Kathamo is based on the following principles:

**Responsive Grid:** Kathamo has a familiar, lightweight 1024 grid as its base, but elegantly scales down to downsized browser windows, tablets, mobile phones (in landscape and portrait).

**Faster Development:** Kathamo is a tool for rapid development with easy CSS and a well-structured Grid.

**Minimal UI:** Kathamo is not a UI framework. It's a development kit that provides the most basic styles as a foundation, but is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is.
